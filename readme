EmailLogger plugin

Send out emails for log entries.
Optional configuration for log levels to send emails, defaults to core log levels only.

Setup:
1.  Install to one of your plugin directories
2.  In app/Config/bootstrap.php add: CakePlugin::load('EmailLogger', array('bootstrap' => true));
3.  Add $email_logger configuration in app/Config/email.php or create EmailLogger/Config/config.php

Configuration(optional):
EmailLogger/Config/config.php
Define which levels and/or email configuration to use for EmailLogger.
Without configuration file, EmailLogger will only send out emails for core log levels

Note: Don't setup your email configuration for EmailLogger with 'log' => true
or any log level which will be handled by EmailLogger

It's not recommended to use this in production. This plugin was developed when playing with
a shared @phpfog CakePHP istallation. No shell and file access.
This plugin is just a quick and dirty way check your app wihtout turning debug on,
or check errors that only occur with debug off.

Hint:
Set 'levels' => array('logger') and it wont ever send out emails for core errors,
and add CakeLog::write('logger', 'testing'); or $this->log('testing', 'log');
to the code you want to debug.
